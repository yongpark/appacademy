# Extra Preparation

## Next Steps

So you're done with the Prep Course curriculum. Now what?

1. **Catch up on sleep.** It's also a good idea to take a couple days
  off during the last week to rest and acclimate. The best advantage
  you can give yourself is to arrive at App Academy rested and ready
  to go for the first day. It's a very intense 12 weeks, and it can
  drain you. Start with a full reservoir.

2. **Review the curriculum** (especially weeks 1 and 2), and make sure
  you understand everything.

3. If you still aren't comfortable with Ruby, do some
  [extra practice][extra-practice].

4. **Master the [fundamentals][fundamentals].** These are super helpful
  for everything you'll do here.

5. **Practice debugging**, particularly debugging **_rspec_ tests**. You
  should be able to use the error message and stack trace to isolate the
  problem.

6. **Go to meetups.** Putting yourself out there and establishing
  connections are important skills when it comes to finding a job. Try
  to find events in your area about Ruby, JavaScript, and other tech
  topics where you can meet others in the field you are entering.
  [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) is a great place to start.

## Extra Topics

Finally, there are certain topics that come later in the course, and it
can be really helpful to have a head-start on them. Here is a list with
the most important topics first.

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript basics
4. Git / Github
5. RegExp
6. Algorithms (particularly sorting algorithms)
